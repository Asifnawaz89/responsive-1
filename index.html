           <p id="pera2">BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>

          <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape.
             Like any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write expletives.</p>
             <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen minutes. Think of 
              it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter. </p>
              <p>We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.
